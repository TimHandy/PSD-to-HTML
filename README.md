# Tutorial by Net Ninja

Learned some great things and reminded me of techniques I had long forgotten.

- Demo of how to make a burger nav (see CSS for notes): I modified the JS to eliminate jQuery and used vanilla JS instead
- Semantic tags: Section, Main, Footer. Often require a heading in them for screen-reader purposes. This header can be moved off the page with text-indent so not visible in normal view
- Picture tag with polyfil to server different sized banner imaged dependent on screensize
- 'wrapper' class added to multiple sections to constrain the size of the width of page
- 3x media queries. Started off at full size, I would have done in reverse with mobile first. 
- Clear fix with :after to create an empty cleared block element
- :nth-child(odd) to clear properly when elements wrap. I have come across this problem several times in the past.
- nth-child(2) to style the middle of three elements
- Use of background images for bullets
- Use of border to make a dividing line, I would have used an hr tag in the past

- See CSS comments in css for further detail.
